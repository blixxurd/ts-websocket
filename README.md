## Websockets with Typescript

A very basic single-file experiment to create barebones chat functionality using typescript. This was built with the intention of experimenting with TS as a means to create a real-time events engine in the browser for wider application as a game backend.

**Users can**: 
- Users can Connect
- Users can Set a unique username 
- Users can Chat with other users
- Users can DM other users 
- Chat history is saved to memory

*Note: This is experimental, and not intended for production use or as a means to display my production code quality.*

**To run:**
- `npm i` 
- `npm run start:dev` 

**Future Experiments**
- JSON Message Payload
- Different "rooms" 
- Additional user commands
- Class based, scalable
- Basic JWT Authorization
